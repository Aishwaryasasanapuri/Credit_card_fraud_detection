Credit Card Fraud Detection Capstone Project , PG Diploma IIIT-B


The Dataset is taken from Kaggle website or can be accessed from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

### Dataset overview

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

### Business Problem Overview
For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.

It has been estimated by Nilson report that by 2020 the banking frauds would account to $30 billion worldwide. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing with new and different ways. 

In the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not just a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denials of legitimate transactions.

### Project Pipeline
The project pipeline can be briefly summarized in the following steps:

- Data Understanding: Here, you need to load the data and understand the features present in it. This would help you choose the features that you will need for your final model.
- Exploratory data analytics (EDA): Normally, in this step, you need to perform univariate and bivariate analyses of the data, followed by feature transformations, if necessary. For the current data set, because Gaussian variables are used, you do not need to perform Z-scaling. However, you can check if there is any skewness in the data and try to mitigate it, as it might cause problems during the model-building phase.
- Class Balancing : Here you can use different class balancing techniques to avoid overfitting of data during Model building.
- Train/Test Split: Now you are familiar with the train/test split, which you can perform in order to check the performance of your models with unseen data. Here, for validation, you can use the k-fold cross-validation method. You need to choose an appropriate k value so that the minority class is correctly represented in the test folds.
- Model-Building/Hyperparameter Tuning: This is the final step at which you can try different models and fine-tune their hyperparameters until you get the desired level of performance on the given dataset. You should try and see if you get a better model by the various sampling techniques.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that since the data is imbalanced it is is more important to identify which are fraudulent transactions accurately than the non-fraudulent. Choose an appropriate evaluation metric which reflects this business goal.
